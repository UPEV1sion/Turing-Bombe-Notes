# Turing-Welchman-Bombe Project Paper

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the project paper.

Two document styles are included: a classic `scrreport` and my own adaption of a `tufte-book`. The latter was the version submitted. 
Both are maintained on the same branch, as they differ in many small details, which would make using the "same" files on different branches error prone.

The customized `tufte-book` uses the commercial Lucida typeface. Once the decision was made to use this style as the main version, all improvements and bug fixes where only applied to the `tufte-book` variant.
